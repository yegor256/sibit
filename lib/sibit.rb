  # You may provide the log you want to see the messages in. If you don't

  # has to respond to the method +info+ or +puts+ in order to receive logging
  # messages.
  #
  # It is recommended to wrap the API in a RetriableProxy from
  # retriable_proxy gem and to configure it to retry on Sibit::Error:
  #
  #  RetriableProxy.for_object(api, on: Sibit::Error)
  #
  # This will help you avoid some temporary network issues.
  #
  # The +api+ argument can be an object or an array of objects. If an array
  # is provided, we will make an attempt to try them one by one, until
  # one of them succeedes.
